## Project Title - Voice Recorder

About The App - The web application will allow a user to record a voice message, enter an email address and send the data to a specific endpoint.

##Technologies/Libraries:

**ReactJs** â€“The front-end of the app is written in React. React is a JavaScript library used for creating interactive user interfaces. Although React can be written in plain JavaScript it also provides a JavaScript syntax extension called JSX. JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript that are eventually rendered to the DOM. 


**React-voice-recorder** - is a JavaScript library for React Application which is used to record voice as audio and download the same.

**Fetch API** - Fetch makes it easier to make asynchronous requests and handle responses better 

## Approach 
My inital sketch for the process was this : ![Recorder idea](/Recorder.png)
The main component is App.js and then I just added VideoRecorder component.
After the user records the voice, is able to replay it and adds his email address, on click of the button the data  is sent to a specific endpoint. ( I assumed that backend is already created and we have the url). 

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`
